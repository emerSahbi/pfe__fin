    Welcome to the portal version of our book "Threat Group Cards: A Threat Actor Encyclopedia", a free PDF we first
    published in 2019 on the ThaiCERT brand and that can still be downloaded here (8 July 2020, outdated now).

    When analyzing security incidents we always face the question which adversary we are possibly dealing with and what
    we know about their prior engagements and TTP, to get a better understanding of how to approach and what else to
    look for.

    This portal aims to create full profiles of all threat groups worldwide that have been identified with all research
    generously shared by anti-virus and security research organizations over the years. It can be used as “threat group
    cards”, as the portal title suggests, to have everything together in an elaborate profile for each threat group. All
    dates shown in the cards are the dates when the stated activities started, not necessarily when the reports about
    them came out.

    All information in this portal comes from public sources (OSINT). The difficult part of attributing campaigns to
    actors has been done by those security research organizations as well. What makes this difficult is the fact that
    there may be some overlap between threat groups, where they share tools or people move between groups, or when
    groups suddenly change tactics or type of target.

    Not all groups have been publicly documented as well as others; most groups have remained rather obscure and, of
    course, not all individual campaigns resulted in public knowledge – targeted companies usually don’t welcome such
    exposure.
    ETDA has a strictly neutral role and everything collected in this portal does in no way signify specific
    endorsements, placing blame on countries or taking sides.

    With that said, compiling this data has been a tremendously interesting journey into the dark world of cybercrime
    and the groups associated with it.
